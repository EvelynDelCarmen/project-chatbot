## Build a Chatbot

This project is all about building a functional chatbot interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. A captivating chatbot that can interact with users, ask questions, display messages, and respond with precision. 

## The problem
The biggest issue I had was that the background image was displaying in my localhost but not in the deployed version, I solved it with some research and put the image in the public directory instead.
